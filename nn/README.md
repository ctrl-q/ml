~~Largely-unfinished, untested~~ neural network built from scratch using numpy. <br>
Good way to learn the inner workings of simple MLPs (and appreciate ML libraries!) <br>
Model architecture: 2 hidden layers with ReLU activations and a softmax nonlinearity at the output layer, making it useful for simple classification tasks. <br>
~~Will be updated if I feel it necessary (which I probably won't)~~ Updated!
