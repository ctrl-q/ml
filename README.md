# ml
Log of the different ML projects/trials/learnings <br>
Some are unfinished (and will be marked as such), some are (if not all) suboptimal in their implementation. <br>
Check the commit history for a chronological view of the projects. <br> <br>

With that being said, feel free to poke around and share ideas! <br>

**N.B.** Most of the notebooks should be run on decent machines, or the cloud. <br>
