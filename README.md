Log of the different ML projects/trials/learnings
Some are unfinished (and will be marked as such), some are (if not all) suboptimal in their implementation.
Check the commit history for a chronological view of the projects.

With that being said, feel free to poke around and share ideas!

N.B. Most of the notebooks should be run on decent machines, or the cloud.
